Although there are many tools that can help\n\t\t\twith performance, there's still a lot you can do as a developer to load your code more\n\t\t\tefficiently. Fortunately, with the help of modern rendering patterns, we can reduce\n\t\t\tcomplexity, bundle sizes, and reduce loading times. In this talk, you'll learn about the\n\t\t\timplementation and use cases of modern rendering patterns including SSR, (on-demand) ISR,\n\t\t\tStreaming SSR, React Server Components, Progressive Rehydration, and Selective\n\t\t\tRehydration.\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t  "}

He’s the creator of the Optic OSS project that brings Git-like version control to the problem of documenting and managing changes to your APIs. Before that he built, contributed to, and advised many of the early tools in the low code space, and before that, he was building game engines during math class. When he’s not writing code, Aidan is one of the hosts of the API Storytelling stream, a runner, and a performing stand-up comic (jokes are builds, the audience is CI, laughs are green checks — you know why I do it).","twitter":"aidandcunniffe","linkedin":"acunniffe","github":"acunniffe","abstract":"\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\t<strong>Make your APIs Developer-friendly</strong>\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\tAPIs are not only ‘programming interfaces’ they’re how teams split work, collaborate with\n\t\t\tone another, share capabilities, and make awesome software.

So let’s talk about how\n\t\t\tgood API design, empathy, and modern tools can help you build better relationships with\n\t\t\tthe teams around you, great APIs, and amazing products. I’ll be sharing some stories from\n\t\t\tmy time in the API space, tools and practices to explore, and some slides from a few\n\t\t\tspecial guests.

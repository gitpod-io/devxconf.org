But the developer tools we use were made for a simpler\n\t\t\ttime, one where developers had more control over all of the software they ran. Today, web\n\t\t\tapplications contain many heterogeneous components, all talking to each other across the\n\t\t\tnetwork, many of them SaaS apps. \"Testing\" in production has become the only way to make\n\t\t\tsense. I'll talk about why we need to update our idea of testing, how we can do better at\n\t\t\tunderstanding prod, and how bringing structure to observability is the way forward for\n\t\t\tboth.\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t  "}

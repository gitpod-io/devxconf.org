This\n\t\t\tchange in deployment practices brought with it a lot of new things to the world developers\n\t\t\t- containers, cloud provider configurations, staging environments, to name a few. Instead\n\t\t\tof coding monoliths, we started to see a shift towards cloud-native applications\n\t\t\tconsisting of multiple microservices.\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\tSo while the way of application deployment has advanced, the workflows and tooling for\n\t\t\tdevelopment have remained stagnant. They didn't adapt completely or feel \"native\" to this\n\t\t\tworld of cloud-native applications. This led to an unpleasant developer experience\n\t\t\tinvolving a massive loss in developer productivity.\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\tThis talk is going to be about how cloud based remote development environments provide a\n\t\t\tsolution to this problem. A new development workflow solution that feels native to the\n\t\t\tmultiple microservices-based applications we see being developed these days. The talk will\n\t\t\tcover what these environments are, how they deliver a more pleasant developer experience,\n\t\t\tand how folks can get started using them with the help of open source tools like Okteto\n\t\t\tCLI.\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t  "}

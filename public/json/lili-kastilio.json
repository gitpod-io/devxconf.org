Recently a Lead Engineer at Snyk working on extending our current languages offering by introducing new languages and language specific concepts into our system in the shape of libraries, parsers and microservices. Spending lots of time working on dependency resolution, understanding the inner workings of package managers and integrating with package registries. When not coding I like to spend my time hanging upside down doing circus things & mentoring others by working on open source side projects in Django + JavaScript.","twitter":"lilianakastilio","linkedin":"kastilioliliana","github":"lili2311","abstract":"\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\t<strong>Why I love incremental delivery and why you should too.</strong>\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\tIn order to innovate and deliver new products that your users will love you often have to\n\t\t\tdesign & build very complex features.

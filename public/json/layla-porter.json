It requires a\n\t\t\tdifferent mindset and approach to writing and developing code. However, once in that\n\t\t\tmindset, it is very difficult not to write tests first.\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t  <p>But why bother writing tests first?</p>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\tIn this session, we will go through the reasons for writing tests before coding, look at\n\t\t\tarchitecture and design principles, such as SOLID and see how it all comes together to\n\t\t\tcreate a more testable and maintainable application.\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t  <p>\n\t\t\tI will show you how to get started writing tests first with practical examples on how to\n\t\t\treprogram a T800 series Terminator so you can start using TDD in your own applications (or\n\t\t\tkiller robots from the future).\n\t\t  </p>\n\t\t  <p>Hasta La Vista badly-written code!</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t  "}

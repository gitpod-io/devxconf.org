            When Heartbleed was discovered, OpenSSL was maintained by a handful of volunteers and
            only one of whom worked full-time. The security flaw caused billions of dollars of
            economic damage yet at the time yearly support to the OpenSSL project only US$2,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much has changed since the 1st of Feburary 2012 and the infrastructure to financially
            support open-source maintainers now exists thanks to the efforts of OpenCollective and
            GitHub Sponsors.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that we all do our part in funding maintainers as it is importance that
            maintainers achieve income diversity as that enables roadmap and project independence.
          </p>

            There are less than 2100 people in the inner GitHub maintainer community. What would the
            future look like if they empowered to become independent artists?
          </p>
          <p>
            If one of those people can help more people better understand a technology or improve
            the developer experience for an entire ecosystem what is the worth/value of that and why
            arenâ€™t we doing that yet?
